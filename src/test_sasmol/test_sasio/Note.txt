replaced all sassie w/ sasmol

need to fix relative path using os.path.join()


opendcd: the file will be cleared and overwritten if existing. Is this expected? Or should we name it open_dcd_write
opendcd: should we write a header to it?

Should the following two be moved/removed from sasio since they are never used?
writedcd_header: the function will write a header to a dcd file, without explicitly returning anything.
writedcd_step: same thing above

opendcd (integrated with dcdio.open_dcd_read): can go up to 6.4gb dcd with no problems
closedcd (integrated with dcdio.close_dcd_write): can go up to 6.4gb dcd with no problems
open_dcd_read: can go up to 6.4gb dcd with no problems
close_dcd_read: can go up to 6.4gb dcd with no problems

readdcd:>=1.2g (>1.0g)
*** error: can't allocate region
*** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

read_dcd_step: need to be excuted frame times in order to get the right coor

read_pdb: will the default for charge to be '  ' and the default occupancy to be 0.0? Should occupancy/beta/charge be a number instead of a string?

initialize_children: is betas necessary? This will make the mask array huge

test_intg_sasio_Files_close_dcd_read.py will fail on entropy with segmentation fault.
